# Build transactional SAP Fiori elements-based Apps with nominated APIs using Tier 2 extensibility model in ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
> When you are developing an RAP Application in SAP S/4 Private Cloud Edition and you identify a artifact like `BAPI` which has a missing C1 released artifact but you find it as `nominated API` , you mitigate the situation by creating a Tier 2 wrapper  
>

You can have a brief understanding on: [ ABAP Cloud - How to mitigate missing released SAP APIs in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA ‚Äì The new ABAP Cloud API enablement guide](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/abap-cloud-how-to-mitigate-missing-released-sap-apis-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud/ba-p/13561479)

# Introduction

**Description**
This repository contains the material for the `Devtoberfest 2024- Clean Core Extensibility with ABAP Cloud in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition` .

## üîéOverview

> This repository is all about how to build wrapper around nominated APIs and use it as RAP BO  ; especially about how to use  when building greenfield implementations.

### Business Scenario
In a nutshell
> We display the list of available materials from `Material Master`in system
> 
> Assign the `Material Master` to `Classification` using nominated API.
>
> If the Material is assigned with `Classification` for the first time we raise an BOR event 
>
> 
This session material guides you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Classification Assignment to Material App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation .
>  
The OData service you are going to implement is based on the SAP GUI transaction MM01/MM02.
>
> To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing  "Materials  & Classification" is requesting you to build a new display only Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing assignment of Material with Classification.
>


<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

>Scenario 2: Assign existing `Materail Master` to a `Classification`
>
We use nominated API , to assign existing `Material` to existing `Classification`.

> We achieve this help of `Action` in RAP.

**Action to do this assignment of Classification to Material**:

**We can do this in classic way directly using SAP GUI transaction MM01/MM02**:

## üõ† Solution Overview

> You can import the solution package **`ZDSAG_PRODUCT_LIST_C1`** **`ZDSAG_PRODUCT_LIST_CLOUD`** into your system* by following [How to download and install this example](#how-to-download-and-install-this-example). 
>
> (*) The supported ABAP systems are 2023 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA.

**ZDSAG_CLASSIFICATION_C1**

>Lets see what are the objects present in this package:

1. ZCL_DSAG_BAPI_OBJCL - Tier 2 Wrapper for nominated API of Material Master to Classification Assignment - `BAPI_OBJCL_CREATE`
2. ZCL_DSAG_CLASS_ASSIGNMENT_CHK  - Tier 2 Wrapper for checking existing `Classification` details assigned to `Material Master` before triggering assignment .
3. ZCL_DSAG_BOR_HANDLER_PRODUCT - BOR Event Handler Implementation

**Note:**  
The package contains other objects as well, but we have given overview of only few key artifacts.

**ZDSAG_CLASIFICATION_CLOUD**

>Lets see what are the objects present in this package:

>BO - Business Object

2. ZDSAG_C_PRODUCT - Root BO Projection View
3. ZDSAG_I_CLASSIFICATIONHELPER - BO for `Classification`
4. ZDSAG_I_CHARACTERISTICHELPER - BO for `Characteristics`
   
**Note:**  
The package contains other objects as well, but we have given overview of only few key artifacts.

## üì§ How to download and install this example

Use the <em>zabapgit_standalone</em> program to install the <em>RAP Nominated APIs consumption Scenario</em> by executing the following steps:
1.  Create software component `ZABAP_ON_CLOUD` using `ABAP For Cloud` as `ABAP Language Version` as mentioned in `Requirement` section of this file.
2.	In your ABAP project, create the package `ZCLASSIFICATION_SAMPLE` as target package for the demo content. Use `ZABAP_ON_CLOUD` as software component. Assign it to a new transport request that you only use for the demo content import. 
3.	In your ABAP project, run the program `zabapgit_standalone`.  
4.	Choose `New Online` and enter the following URL of this repository  `https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-nominated-apis-consumption`. 
5.	In the package field, enter the newly created package `ZCLASSIFICATION_SAMPLE`. In the branch field, select the branch `ABAP-platform-2023-classification-maintenance`.
6.	Leave the other fields unchanged and choose `Create Online Repo`.
7. Enter your credentials for abapgit. You will see the available artifacts to import into your ABAP system. 
8.	Choose `Pull` and confirm every subpackage on your transport request. 
9.	Select the package `ZCLASSIFICATION_SAMPLE` to be overwritten with the demo content. 
10. You will get an information screen telling you to only make repairs when they are urgent, which you can confirm.  
11. In the following screen, select all inactive objects and confirm the activation.
12.	Once the cloning has finished, refresh your project tree.


As a result of the installation procedure above, the ABAP system creates an inactive version of all artifacts from the demo content and adds the following sub packages to the target package: 
* `ZDSAG_PRODUCT_LIST_C1`
* `ZDSAG_PRODUCT_LIST_CLOUD`

## Configuration

To generate service artifacts for the service bindings:
1. In each service binding, choose the button `Publish`.


NOTE: In case the activation via the button in the service bindings is not possible, you can use Gateway tools to activate the service, see [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/fc4c71aa50014fd1b43721701471913d/b58a3c27df4e406f9335d4b346f6be04.html?version=202210.LATEST#%EE%81%B0-service-transport2).
