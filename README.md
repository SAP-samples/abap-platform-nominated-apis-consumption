# Build transactional SAP Fiori elements-based Apps with nominated APIs using Tier 2 extensibility model in ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
> When you are developing an RAP Application in SAP S/4 Private Cloud Edition and you identify a artifact like `BAPI` which has a missing C1 released artifact but you find it as `nominated API` , you mitigate the situation by creating a Tier 2 wrapper  
>

You can have a brief understanding on: [ ABAP Cloud - How to mitigate missing released SAP APIs in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA ‚Äì The new ABAP Cloud API enablement guide](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/abap-cloud-how-to-mitigate-missing-released-sap-apis-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud/ba-p/13561479)
