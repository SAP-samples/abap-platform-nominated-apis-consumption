# Build transactional SAP Fiori elements-based Apps with nominated APIs using Tier 2 extensibility model in ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
> When you are developing an RAP Application in SAP S/4 Private Cloud Edition and you identify a artifact like `BAPI` which has a missing C1 released artifact but you find it as `nominated API` , you mitigate the situation by creating a Tier 2 wrapper  
>

You can have a brief understanding on: [ ABAP Cloud - How to mitigate missing released SAP APIs in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA ‚Äì The new ABAP Cloud API enablement guide](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/abap-cloud-how-to-mitigate-missing-released-sap-apis-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud/ba-p/13561479)

# Introduction

**Description**
This repository contains the material for the `Devtoberfest 2024- Clean Core Extensibility with ABAP Cloud in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition` . 

It includes two packages:
>ZDSAG_CLASIFICATION_CLOUD(ABAP Cloud Language Version) - Contains managed Business Object (BO) with BO nodes or entities, BO projection views, late numbering, determine actions, actions, side effects, functions, business event exposure, and additional save.

>ZDSAG_CLASSIFICATION_C1( Standard ABAP Language Version) - Contains wrapper for Nominated APIs and CDS entity for not C1 released artifact.

## üîéOverview

> This repository is all about how to build wrapper around nominated APIs and use it as RAP BO  ; especially about how to use  when building greenfield implementations.

### Business Scenario
In a nutshell
> We create/update `Classification` using nominated APIs
> 
> Assign the `Classification` to `Material Master` using nominated API.
>
> If the Material is assigned with `Classification` for the first time we raise an BOR event 
>
> 
This session material guides you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Classification Processing App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation with unmanaged save and  late numbering.
>  
> Here we chose  `unmanaged save` as we intend to use nominated APIs aka `BAPI` for CRUDQ trasanctional capabilities .
>
The OData service you are going to implement is based on the SAP GUI transaction CL01/CL02/CL03.
>
> To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing "Classification" is requesting you to build a new Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing (i.e. creating, updating and deleting) classification.
>


<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

>Scenario 1: Creation and Update existing `Classification`
>
The resulting _Classification Processing App_ app is a SAP Fiori elements-based List Report app with search, filter, and draft capabilities for processing _Classification_ . A navigation to an Object Page for displaying the details of each _Classification_ entry in the list report is offered. The application will look like this: 

**List Report**:
<img src="images/ListReport.png" alt="Classification App - List Report" width="100%">
  
**Object Page**: 
<img src="images/ObjectPage.png" alt="Classification App - Object Page" width="100%">

Let us breakdown of  SAP GUI transaction _CL01_ which comprises of different section(information stored across multiple database)   _Classification App_ .

**Basic Data**:
<img src="images/CL01_Basic_Data.png" alt="CL01-Basic Data" width="100%">

**Keywords**:
<img src="images/CL01_Keywords.png" alt="CL01-Keywords" width="100%">

**Characteristics**:
<img src="images/CL01_Characteristics.png" alt="CL01-Characteristics" width="100%">

**So we would be building a RAP application that would be a mimic of these sections from CL01/CL02/CL03.**
<img src="images/GUI_RAP application.png" alt="SAP GUI CL01 transaction to RAP Application" width="80%">

**Disclaimer**: We have taken only few sections from CL01 transaction for this sample.


Below is the simplified _Classification_ data model underlying the app.

<img src="images/Flowdiagram.png" alt="Classification Creation/Updation Model" width="100%">

>Scenario 2: Assign existing `Classification` to a `Material Master`
>
We use nominated API , to assign existing `Classification` to existing `Material`.

> We achieve this help of `Action` in RAP.

**Action to do this assignment of Classification to Material**:
<img src="images/RAP _Action.png" alt="RAP Action" width="100%">

**We can do this in classic way directly using SAP GUI transaction MM01/MM02**:

**ZDSAG_CLASSIFICATION_C1**

>Lets see what are the objects present in this package:

1. ZDSAG_BAPI_CLASS_CREATE - Tier 2 Wrapper for nominated API of Classification Creation - `BAPI_CLASS_CREATE`
2. ZDSAG_BAPI_CLASS_CHANGE - Tier 2 Wrapper for nominated API of Classification Update -`BAPI_CLASS_CHANGE`
